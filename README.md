Don't judge my baking skills! - Trying out coding

03/01/22

Still learning how to use git and github so please make sure you check for the latest updates as they might not be in order! e.g. Disposable.py is probably more up to date than Apple Pie Todo.py (yes, I forgot and put spaces in the title... I'm new!)

For this repository you shoud have a Shopping_List.txt and Ingredients_in_stock.txt file in the same programme. I currently do but I'm still figuring out whether to, and where to, add to github. Regardless, two empty textfiles with the above names will suffice.

WHY?

This is a mini project I have made up loosely based on various common examples given when learning python.

Following some theory and some Hello World copying I decided to sit down and start trying to remember and give meaning to the code I was writing. For this project I was near an apple pie when I thought of it. 

The recipe is terrible and the usefulness of the programme can be debated but the intent was to be able to practice my coding, remember what I had learnt, show my workings out, save to a place for later refining and additions, learn how to use git and github. It seems to be working really well - although I still have a bit to learn yet!
